Okay so I am going to be very blunt. Backend javascript absolutley terrifies me. Like I could cry just thinking about it. So here's to trying my best and probably messing up.

### Commands:
This app is used to verify the speed of an airplane, boat or car. Or at least that is what I attempted to do.

- 1 - Verify the speed of a Lamborghini(car): 
$node app drive --speed=100 --car=Lamborghini

- 2 - Verify the speed of a Runabout(boat): 
$node app sail --speed=50 --boat=Runabout

- 3 - Verify the speed of a Boeing 777(airplane): 
$node app fly --speed=1000 --airplane=Boeing-777
